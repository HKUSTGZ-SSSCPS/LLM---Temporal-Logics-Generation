This repository contains six experiments, namely, AutoSafeLTL(our work), AutoSafeLTL-B, nl2spec, nl2spec+B, AutoSafeLTL-C, and AutoSafeLTL-D. (where B represents the Automated Verification component of our framework, C represents Agent LLM1 proposed by our work, and D represents Agent LLM2 proposed by our work)
As nl2spec built a frontend, we use the frontend instead of writing code; guidance on how to run the frontend can be found in 'https://github.com/realChrisHahn2/nl2spec'. You need to have an opneai API(but not a UST-gz's restructed API).
