## Round1

This loop represents the general process of this project, where:

The **`Round1.py`** section includes the automatic generation of natural language, NL2LTL conversion, syntax checking of the LTL, and then performing LTL2HOA and HOA2BA transformations.

The **`Round2.py`** section involves checking the conclusion with RABIT and performing semantic check reprompt.



This loop is currently in a draft state; refined iterative versions can be found in Round2, 3, and so on...
